# Bayesian-Linear-Model-Comparison

Comparing different inference algorithm on a Bayesian linear model with the Prestige dataset [1]. Bayesian linear Model and Variational Bayes algorithm are from Brodersen's tutorial [2].

Comparing different algorithms
  1. Variational Bayes (under development)
  2. Metropilis-Hasting Algorithm (under development)
  3. Elliptical slice sampler for Beta [3]
